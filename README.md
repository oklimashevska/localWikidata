Here I present my coding part of the team Master project "Local Open Research Data And Wikidata".

Folder structure:
- ./src/ contains
   - the injection script that inserts data to Wikidata at the localhost [http://192.168.99.100:8181/api.php](http://192.168.99.100:8181/api.php);
   - the script that generates histograms.

N.B.1. The scripts were written in Python 2.

N.B.2. Due to privacy, the input data cannot be presented here.
